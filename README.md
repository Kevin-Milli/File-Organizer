# Automatic File Organizer

Welcome to the Automatic File Organizer! This script will help you organize your files quickly 
and efficiently by automatically sorting them into subfolders based on file type.

## Configuration

You can easily customize the file organization to suit your needs:

* Extensions by Category: File extensions are assigned to the following categories:
* Images (png, jpeg, jpg)
* Documents (txt, doc, odt, xlsx)
* Audio (mp3, wav)
* Avoided Extensions: You can specify file extensions to be avoided, 
  so they won't be moved to the destination folder.
  
## Usage
